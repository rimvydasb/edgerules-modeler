/**
 * The EdgeRules DSL of the loan origination model: a joint mortgage application goes through the steps of a bank
 * origination process. The model is layered, as in the EdgeRules playground:
 *
 * - **Structure:** the `Applicant` and `Application` types are the input data. `owner application` links an applicant
 *   to the application that holds it.
 * - **Facts:** `facts Applicant` derives the age and the disposable income of every applicant; `facts Application`
 *   derives the loan-to-value and the household budget.
 * - **Knowledge:** `creditPolicy`, the `applicantScorecard` scorecard, the `riskGrade`, `pricingGrid` and
 *   `decisionMatrix` decision tables, the `policyRules` knockout rules and the `affordability` stress test.
 * - **Decisions:** one business question per decision: `ApplicantScore` and `ApplicantPolicy` per applicant,
 *   `HouseholdRisk`, `LoanPricing`, `LoanDecision` and `LoanOffer` per application.
 * - **Service:** `loanOriginationDecision` is the external contract; `originationBook` and `capacityBook` are the
 *   workbooks. `jointApplication` builds an `Application` from two `ApplicantProfile`s: an `Applicant` typed before it
 *   is in an `Application` keeps no owner, so its facts stay `Missing` (`docs/engine-bug-reports.md`).
